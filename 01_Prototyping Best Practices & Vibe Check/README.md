## 🏗️ How AIM Does Assignments

> 📅 **Assignments will always be released to students as live class begins.** We will never release assignments early.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓ **Questions** – these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!

- 🏗️ **Activities** – these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.

- 🚧 **Advanced Builds (optional)** – Take on a challenge! These builds require you to create something with minimal guidance outside of the documentation. Completing an Advanced Build earns full credit in place of doing the base assignment notebook questions/activities.

### Main Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE8 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application.

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE8/tree/main/00_Setting%20Up%20Git)!

#### 🏗️ Activity #1

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.
    - Aspect Tested: Technical explanation and simplification skills - ability to break down complex programming concepts into beginner-friendly terms using analogies and clear structure.
    - Performance: Excellent - Used toy box analogy effectively, maintained helpful tutor persona, provided clear numbered structure, and engaged with follow-up question. System successfully simplified OOP concepts while maintaining technical accuracy.
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
    - Aspect Tested: Reading comprehension, information recall, and summarization skills - ability to read complex technical content, identify and retain key information, and synthesize it into a concise summary.
    - Performance: Excellent - Successfully understood technical concepts about storage redundancy, accurately recalled specific details (K+M shards, 6/16 example), and effectively condensed main points while preserving technical accuracy. Demonstrated strong synthesis abilities.
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested: Creative writing and imaginative storytelling abilities - capacity to generate original, engaging narratives within word constraints while incorporating emotional depth and unexpected elements.
    - Performance: Excellent - Generated original story with unique characters (XR-7 robot, bird) and setting (scrapyard), created truly unexpected friendship, met word count requirement (~120-130 words), conveyed emotional themes of loneliness and joy, and used vivid imagery. Demonstrated strong creative capabilities.
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested: Mathematical reasoning, word problem comprehension, and logical problem-solving skills - ability to parse word problems, extract relevant information, and perform basic arithmetic calculations to find solutions.
    - Performance: Excellent - Correctly identified key information (packs of 4 apples, packs of 3 oranges, need 12 apples, need 9 oranges), applied correct division operations (12÷4=3, 9÷3=3), organized solution clearly with separate calculations, and provided accurate answer (3 packs of each). Demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning.
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…
    - Aspect Tested: Tone transformation and prompt adherence skills - ability to follow specific instructions about writing style and tone while maintaining content accuracy and coherence.
    - Performance: Excellent - Successfully converted casual, conversational tone to formal, professional tone, followed instruction exactly, maintained all key concepts while changing presentation, upgraded vocabulary appropriately, and achieved suitable formality level for business/technical writing. Demonstrated strong instruction-following and professional writing skills.

This "vibe check" now serves as a baseline, of sorts, to help understand what holes your application has.

#### A Note on Vibe Checking

>"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.
>
>In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

#### ❓Question #1

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?

##### ✅ Answer

Vibe checking has several significant limitations as an evaluation tool:

1. **Lack of Systematicity**: Vibe checks are informal and unstructured, which means they may miss important edge cases or failure modes that systematic testing would catch.

2. **Subjective Assessment**: The evaluation relies heavily on human judgment, which can be inconsistent, biased, or influenced by the evaluator's expectations and experience level.

3. **Limited Coverage**: A few test cases cannot comprehensively evaluate all possible inputs, scenarios, or use cases that the system might encounter in production.

4. **No Quantitative Metrics**: Vibe checks don't provide measurable, comparable metrics that can be tracked over time or compared across different systems.

5. **Confirmation Bias**: Evaluators may unconsciously focus on positive results and overlook subtle failures or inconsistencies.

6. **No Stress Testing**: Vibe checks typically don't test system behavior under high load, unusual inputs, or adversarial conditions.

7. **Temporal Limitations**: A single vibe check represents only a snapshot in time and doesn't account for system degradation or changes over time.

8. **Missing Edge Cases**: Informal testing often misses boundary conditions, error handling, and unusual but valid inputs that could cause failures in real-world usage.

While vibe checks are useful for initial validation and catching obvious failures, they should be complemented with more rigorous, systematic testing approaches for production systems.

### 🚧 Advanced Build (OPTIONAL)

Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check you completed above, then deploy the changes to your Vercel domain [(see these instructions from your Challenge project)](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge/blob/main/README.md) and redo the above vibe check.

> NOTE: You may reach for improving the model, changing the prompt, or any other method.

## Submitting Your Homework

### Main Assignment (Activity #1 only)

Follow these steps to prepare and submit your homework:

1. Pull the latest updates from upstream into the main branch of your AIE8 repo:
    - For your initial repo setup see [00_Setting Up Git/README.md](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE8/tree/main/00_Setting%20Up%20Git)
    - To get the latest updates from AI Makerspace into your own AIE8 repo, run the following commands:

    ```
    git checkout main
    git pull upstream main
    git push origin main
    ```

2. **IMPORTANT:** Start Cursor from the `01_Prototyping Best Practices & Vibe Check` folder (you can also use the _File -> Open Folder_ menu option of an existing Cursor window)
3. Create a branch of your `AIE8` repo to track your changes. Example command: `git checkout -b s01-assignment`
4. Edit this `README.md` file (the one in your `AIE8/01_Prototyping Best Practices & Vibe Check` folder)
5. Perform a "Vibe check" evaluation your AI-Engineering-Challenge system using the five questions provided above
6. For each Activity question:
    - Define the “Aspect Tested”
    - Comment on how your system performed on it.
7. Provide an answer to `❓Question #1:` after the `✅ Answer:` prompt
8. Add, commit and push your modified `README.md` to your origin repository.

>(NOTE: You should not merge the new document into origin's main branch. This will spare you from update challenges for each future session.)

When submitting your homework, provide the GitHub URL to the tracking branch (for example: `s01-assignment`) you created on your AIE8 repo.
