## üèóÔ∏è How AIM Does Assignments

> üìÖ **Assignments will always be released to students as live class begins.** We will never release assignments early.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ‚ùì **Questions** ‚Äì these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!

- üèóÔ∏è **Activities** ‚Äì these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.

- üöß **Advanced Builds (optional)** ‚Äì Take on a challenge! These builds require you to create something with minimal guidance outside of the documentation. Completing an Advanced Build earns full credit in place of doing the base assignment notebook questions/activities.

### Main Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE8 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application.

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE8/tree/main/00_Setting%20Up%20Git)!

#### üèóÔ∏è Activity #1

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.
    - Aspect Tested: Technical explanation and simplification skills - ability to break down complex programming concepts into beginner-friendly terms using analogies and clear structure.
    - Performance: Excellent - Used toy box analogy effectively, maintained helpful tutor persona, provided clear numbered structure, and engaged with follow-up question. System successfully simplified OOP concepts while maintaining technical accuracy.
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points‚Ä¶
    - Aspect Tested: Reading comprehension, information recall, and summarization skills - ability to read complex technical content, identify and retain key information, and synthesize it into a concise summary.
    - Performance: Excellent - Successfully understood technical concepts about storage redundancy, accurately recalled specific details (K+M shards, 6/16 example), and effectively condensed main points while preserving technical accuracy. Demonstrated strong synthesis abilities.
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100‚Äì150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested: Creative writing and imaginative storytelling abilities - capacity to generate original, engaging narratives within word constraints while incorporating emotional depth and unexpected elements.
    - Performance: Excellent - Generated original story with unique characters (XR-7 robot, bird) and setting (scrapyard), created truly unexpected friendship, met word count requirement (~120-130 words), conveyed emotional themes of loneliness and joy, and used vivid imagery. Demonstrated strong creative capabilities.
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested: Mathematical reasoning, word problem comprehension, and logical problem-solving skills - ability to parse word problems, extract relevant information, and perform basic arithmetic calculations to find solutions.
    - Performance: Excellent - Correctly identified key information (packs of 4 apples, packs of 3 oranges, need 12 apples, need 9 oranges), applied correct division operations (12√∑4=3, 9√∑3=3), organized solution clearly with separate calculations, and provided accurate answer (3 packs of each). Demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning.
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone‚Ä¶
    - Aspect Tested: Tone transformation and prompt adherence skills - ability to follow specific instructions about writing style and tone while maintaining content accuracy and coherence.
    - Performance: Excellent - Successfully converted casual, conversational tone to formal, professional tone, followed instruction exactly, maintained all key concepts while changing presentation, upgraded vocabulary appropriately, and achieved suitable formality level for business/technical writing. Demonstrated strong instruction-following and professional writing skills.

This "vibe check" now serves as a baseline, of sorts, to help understand what holes your application has.

#### A Note on Vibe Checking

>"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.
>
>In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

#### ‚ùìQuestion #1

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?

##### ‚úÖ Answer

Vibe checking has several significant limitations as an evaluation tool:

1. **Lack of Systematicity**: Vibe checks are informal and unstructured, which means they may miss important edge cases or failure modes that systematic testing would catch.

2. **Subjective Assessment**: The evaluation relies heavily on human judgment, which can be inconsistent, biased, or influenced by the evaluator's expectations and experience level.

3. **Limited Coverage**: A few test cases cannot comprehensively evaluate all possible inputs, scenarios, or use cases that the system might encounter in production.

4. **No Quantitative Metrics**: Vibe checks don't provide measurable, comparable metrics that can be tracked over time or compared across different systems.

5. **Confirmation Bias**: Evaluators may unconsciously focus on positive results and overlook subtle failures or inconsistencies.

6. **No Stress Testing**: Vibe checks typically don't test system behavior under high load, unusual inputs, or adversarial conditions.

7. **Temporal Limitations**: A single vibe check represents only a snapshot in time and doesn't account for system degradation or changes over time.

8. **Missing Edge Cases**: Informal testing often misses boundary conditions, error handling, and unusual but valid inputs that could cause failures in real-world usage.

While vibe checks are useful for initial validation and catching obvious failures, they should be complemented with more rigorous, systematic testing approaches for production systems.

### üöß Advanced Build (OPTIONAL)

Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check you completed above, then deploy the changes to your Vercel domain [(see these instructions from your Challenge project)](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge/blob/main/README.md) and redo the above vibe check.

> NOTE: You may reach for improving the model, changing the prompt, or any other method.

## Submitting Your Homework

### Main Assignment (Activity #1 only)

Follow these steps to prepare and submit your homework:

1. Pull the latest updates from upstream into the main branch of your AIE8 repo:
    - For your initial repo setup see [00_Setting Up Git/README.md](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE8/tree/main/00_Setting%20Up%20Git)
    - To get the latest updates from AI Makerspace into your own AIE8 repo, run the following commands:

    ```
    git checkout main
    git pull upstream main
    git push origin main
    ```

2. **IMPORTANT:** Start Cursor from the `01_Prototyping Best Practices & Vibe Check` folder (you can also use the _File -> Open Folder_ menu option of an existing Cursor window)
3. Create a branch of your `AIE8` repo to track your changes. Example command: `git checkout -b s01-assignment`
4. Edit this `README.md` file (the one in your `AIE8/01_Prototyping Best Practices & Vibe Check` folder)
5. Perform a "Vibe check" evaluation your AI-Engineering-Challenge system using the five questions provided above
6. For each Activity question:
    - Define the ‚ÄúAspect Tested‚Äù
    - Comment on how your system performed on it.
7. Provide an answer to `‚ùìQuestion #1:` after the `‚úÖ Answer:` prompt
8. Add, commit and push your modified `README.md` to your origin repository.

>(NOTE: You should not merge the new document into origin's main branch. This will spare you from update challenges for each future session.)
